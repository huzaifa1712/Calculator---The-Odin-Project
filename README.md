# Calculator - The Odin Project

## Site Preview: https://odin-project-calculator-2171.netlify.app

- Add, Subtract, Divide, Multiply, %(divide by 100), negate, floating point(.), backspace and AC button
- Supports keyboard input for numbers and most of the above operations (minus is ambiguous so negate has no corresponding keyboard input)
- Evaluates input one operation at a time

### Future extensions:
- Order of operations
- Scientific calculator
